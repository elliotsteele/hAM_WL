    CODE                            - source code for the framework
    MSCSF_state_and_geometry_files  - directory containing all state and geometry files (see instruction 2).
    Simulations                     - simulations folder
    Example_scripts                 - further directories with example scripts for most functionality

1) Compile the code.
    
    Navigate to "CODE"
    Copy the Makefile_linux or Makefile_mac to a file called "Makefile"
    Type "make"
    This will compile everything:

    •	“model_single_native”   – Single cell implementations for traditional cell models
    •	“model_tissue_native”   – Tissue implementations using traditional cell models
    •   "bin_to_vtk_tissue"     - converts binary data to plain text and/or vtk data files; tissue models

    You can also type   "make x" where x is the executable name without the "model_" prefix to compile just that implementation.
                        "make bin_to_vtk_{tissue/3Dcell}" to compile just these post-processing tools

2) Set your path - this is the location your tissue geometry and all state files will be stored/read/written
    
    Move the folder "MSCSF_state_and_geometry_files" to a sensible location
    Add the full path to PATH.txt e.g. "/Users/username/MSCSF_state_and_geometry_files"

3) Run code
    
    Can run within the CODE folder, but it is suggested to run elsewhere (e.g. simulations folder).
    Copy the executable desired and PATH.txt to your simulations folder
    Execute with default setup: ./model_X

4) Running the code with non-default options

    Multiple example scripts have been provided in Example_scripts, to demonstrate full functionality.
    Use the below instructions and the exmaples as a guide to perform any simulation you like.
    
    Executable can be run with any number of options for settings, passed as command line arguments:

    • "./model_X ARG1 VALUE ARG2 VALUE ..."
    
    Any number of arguments  may be passed and in any order - as long as the value follows the associated argument
    run "./model_X Display_args" to print to screen all argument options for that implementation
    Full options and description is in the documentation; below (point 7) are given just the basics.
    Also refer to the example scripts, or copy desired scripts into your simulations folder and modify them as desired.

5) Main outputs (full list in documentation):
    
    The simulations will produce multiple outputs.
    • In the parent directory, "Log.dat" contains a log of all simulations performed, the time set, and settings
    • In the parent directory will be created an "Outputs_X" directory where X is determined by 1) executable run and 2) any reference passed in.
    This folder contains all the outputs for simulations associated with X.
    Within this folder are:

    • All models:
        • "Outputs_X/Results_Y/         - Directory (containing time traces for cellular data - ("Y" is determined by a results reference if passed)
            • Currents.dat              - time courses of voltage, membrane currents, gating variables and ionic concentrations
            • Properties.dat            - measured properties (dvdt, APD, CaT_min/max etc) for the final two beats of a simulation
            • Vm_linescan_x.dat         - Idealised tissue models only; contains rows of voltage for an x-linescan, one row per ms
            • CRU.dat                   - 3Dcell/integrated models only; detailed time courses of calcium concentration and calcium handling dynamics
            • Ca_linescan_{x/y/z}.dat"  - 3Dcell models only; linescans crossing through the centre of the cell in x, y and z 
            • Note:                     - For tissue models, data for three different cells within the tissue will be written, with "_cell_{1-3}.dat"
                                          appended to the filenames for Currents, Properties and CRU.
    
        • "Outputs_X/Results_Y/Settings.dat" - text file - record of all of the settings for the most recent simulation X+Y; equivilent to screen outputs
        • "Outputs_X/Properties_log.dat"     - text file - contains a single line entry of final measured properties for every simulation within Outputs_X - appended.

    • Single-cell models only:
        • "Outputs_X/Parameters_Y/
            • Ix.dat                        - All voltage dependent parameters/variables for current Ix
            • Magnitude_parameters.dat      - A list of the final values of all ion channel conductances and calcium handling maximal flux rates (all het and mod included)
            • Modifier_parameters.dat"      - A list of the final values of all modifiers (scale factors, voltage shifts, time-constant scaling etc)
            • Voltage clamp files (if Vclamp is set to On):
                • I{CaL/K/K1}_IV.dat       - Current (peak) voltage relationship for ICaL, Ito, IKur, IKr, IKs and IK1
                • I{CaL/K}_Vclamp_trace_Z.dat  - time courses of currents for voltage step Z
                • I{CaL/K}_Vclamp_traces.dat   - time courses for all voltage steps, in sequence 
       
    • Tissue models: 
        • "Outputs_X/Spatial_Results_Y" - Directory (containing spatial output data where relevant - tissue and 3D cell models)
            • Note:                     - By default, outputs binary files. These can be converted to plain text or vtk file data 
                                          using the supplied tools (see Section 6 below) - binary data of course saves space.
            • Tissue models:
                • Vm_output_t.{bin/vtk}      - where t is the time in ms; contains the voltage for all tissue (.bin) and all space (.vtk). 
 
            • Note:                      - you can output any spatial variable in native or integrated models if you like:
                                           in the relevant main file (Tissue_native_main.cc/Tissue_integrated_main.cc/Single_cell_3D_main.cc)
                                           navigate to the spatial data outputs (search function "vtk_3D_output" or "array_1D_output") and
                                           follow the format of the variables already output, passing in an appropriate string reference.

            • All maps (tissue and 3D cell models), geometries and fibres and final activation pattern (tissue models only) 
                will also be output in "Outputs_X" for inspection, verification, and figures.

    • Outputs_X/Parameters_Y/Magnitide_parameters.dat and Modifier_parameters.dat contain strings with the variables and values in the files

6) Visualsing spatial data (Tissue models):

    If running these models, with default settings, the simulation will write only binary data for the spatial outputs 
        (vtk files can be output directly by the model - see arguments below)

    Use the provided tools to convert the binary data to plain text or vtk data files:
    From within the same directory where the simulation was performed, or in a parent directory containing the Outputs directory you want to analyse, 
    run: "./bin_to_vtk_{tissue/3Dcell}” with arguments identifying the simulation and conversion settings:

        •	Any Reference and Results_Reference passed (so it knows which directory to look in to read binary and write data/vtk files)
        •	The variable you want to convert (i.e. Vm, Ca, CaSR etc): Variable [V]
        •	The Tissue_order and Tissue_model (tissue) or Cell_size and Sim_cell_size (3Dcell) used to perform the simulation (so it knows geometry sizes and files etc).
        •	Which type of data to write: Write_data [On/Off] (plain text) and/or Write_vtk [On/Off] 
        •	The time range and time interval over which to convert data: start_time [n1] end_time [n2] interval [n3]
        •	For tissue models, you need to also specify the model type (Model_type [native/integrated])
        
    Examples: 
        "./bin_to_vtk_tissue start_time 100 end_time 200 interval 10 Model_type integrated Variable Cai Write_vtk On Write_data On. Tissue_order 2D Tissue_model basic Reference X Results_Reference Y"

            RyR_Po, LTCC_po         [x]         -> integrated cell models only; scales the open transition rate. 

    • Tissue modulation (Tissue model only!):
        Dscale                  [x]         -> scales D1 (homogeneously if no map is set); D_AR preserved, so D2 calculated from scaled D1
        D_AR_scale              [x]         -> scales D_AR (D1 = D/D_AR) (homogeneously if no mpa is set)
        Dscale_mod_map          [On/Off]    -> Apply Dscale according to map; map is floats, where map = 0, Dscale_local = 1(=D1) (i.e. control), 
                                                where map = 1, Dscale_local = Dscale(=D1*Dscale) (i.e. fully scaled according to value in Dscale)
        Dscale_mod_map_file     [string]    -> Define explicitly the filename containing the Dscale modulation map
        D_AR_scale_mod_map      [On/Off]    -> Apply D_AR_scale according to map; map is floats, where map = 0, D_AR_scale_local = 1(=D_AR) (i.e. control), 
                                                where map = 1, D_AR_scale_local = D_AR_scale(=D_AR*D_AR_scale) (i.e. fully scaled according to value in Dscale)
        D_AR_scale_mod_map_file [string]    -> Define explicitly the filename containing the D_AR_scale modulation map
        {ISO/ACh/Remodelling/Dscale_mod/D_AR_scale_mod}_map  [On/Off]  -> Whether to apply single-cell modulations homogeneously to tissue, or by map 
                                                                        (exactly as with D_scale: map determines where zero-maximum effect of modulation is applied.
        Direct_modulation_map   [On/Off]    -> Whether to apply direct modulation (X_scale;Ix_va_ss_shift;Ix_vi_ss_shift;Ix_va_tau_scale;Ix_vi_tau_scale) 
                                                homogeneously or by map. MAP MUST BE INTEGER for direct_mod on or off, not continuos (as with above maps)
        {X}_map_file            [filename]  -> explicitly set the file for the modulation map X (X=ISO/ACh/Remodelling .....)

8) Using a settings file
    
    You can use settings files to store the options passed in, for quick reproduction etc
    These files can be anywhere, where the full path of the file must be passed in after "Settings_file" argument.
    You can use a settings file AND command line arguments:
        "Settings_file" argument must be passed FIRST (this is the only restriction on order of arguments)
        Any arguments passed after this will supplement or overwrite the options in the file 
        -> command line args supersede settings files if the same argument is in both.

    Settings files must have the following format as a plain text document,
    new line for each argument, spaces or tabs to separate arg and value:
    
        Number of args
        ARG 1   Value 1
        ARG 2   Value 2 
    
    Example: An example settings_file could have contents:
        3
        BCL 345
        Model hAM_CRN
        Results_Reference file_test

    And performing:
        ./model_single_native Settings_file [filename] Remodelling AF_GB
        will apply BCL = 345; Model = hAM_CRN; Results_Reference = file_test; Remodelling = AF_GB
